Conditional Statements:

if statement: Used to execute a block of code conditionally based on a certain condition. For example, checking if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access certain parts of a website.

if...else statement: Used to execute one block of code if a certain condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. For example, checking if a user's input is valid and displaying an error message if it's not.

else...if ladder: Used to execute a series of conditions, one after another, until a condition is met. For example, checking a user's age and displaying different messages based on their age range.

ternary operator: Used as a shorthand for an if...else statement when there are only two possible outcomes. For example, setting a variable's value based on a condition.

Loop Statements:

for loop: Used to iterate over a certain number of times. For example, creating a loop to display a list of items on a webpage.

while loop: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly while a certain condition is true. For example, reading input from a user until they enter a valid value.

do...while loop: Similar to a while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition. For example, prompting a user for input and validating their input before continuing.

for...in loop: Used to iterate over the properties of an object. For example, iterating over an object's properties to display them in a table on a webpage.

for...of loop: Used to iterate over the values of an iterable object like an array or a string. For example, looping over an array to perform some operation on each element.

Control Statements:

break statement: Used to exit out of a loop or a switch statement. For example, breaking out of a loop once a certain condition is met.

continue statement: Used to skip to the next iteration of a loop. For example, skipping over certain elements in an array that don't meet a certain condition.

return statement: Used to exit out of a function and return a value. For example, calculating the sum of two numbers and returning the result.

Switch Statement: Used to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable. For example, checking the value of a dropdown menu and performing a different action based on the selected option.

Exception Handling Statements:

try...catch statement: Used to handle runtime errors that may occur in a block of code. For example, catching a network error when making an HTTP request and displaying an error message to the user.
Labelled Statements:

label statement: Used to provide a label for a loop or a block of code. For example, labelling a loop to exit out of it from a nested loop.
break statement with label: Used to exit out of a loop with a specific label. For example, breaking out of a nested loop from an outer loop.
